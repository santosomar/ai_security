The following examples provide a very simplified proof-of-concept code sample demonstrating a membership inference attack on a trained machine learning model. The examples use Python, PyTorch, and the CIFAR10 dataset for simplicity. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10,000 images. The dataset is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6,000 images per class. 

Researchers use this dataset to build algorithms that can learn from these images and then test them on a reserved set of images that the algorithm has not seen before, measuring how well the algorithm can generalize what it has learned to new data. The CIFAR-10 dataset is relatively simple but has enough variety and complexity to test algorithms on real-world data without requiring substantial computational resources to process.

#Loading the necessary modules and dataset
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, random_split
from torch.nn import functional as F

# Load the CIFAR10 dataset
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])

# 50000 training images and 10000 test images
trainset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
testset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)

# split the 50000 training images into 40000 training and 10000 shadow
train_dataset, shadow_dataset = random_split(trainset, [40000, 10000])

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
shadow_loader = DataLoader(shadow_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(testset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
```

The code in below defines the model (a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR10 classification).
```
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks that are specifically designed to process pixel data and are often used for image recognition tasks.  CNNs can take in an input image, process it, and classify it under certain categories (like identifying whether an image is of a cat or a dog). Traditional neural networks are not ideal for image processing and can be practically impossible to use for larger images. 

Training the target model:
```
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
target_model = Net().to(device)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(target_model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(10):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
        # get the inputs; data is a list of [inputs, labels]
        inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)

        # zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # forward + backward + optimize
        outputs = target_model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

print('Finished Training the Target Model')
```

Then you need to train the shadow model, as demonstrated below:

```
shadow_model = Net().to(device)

optimizer = optim.SGD(shadow_model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(10):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
    for i, data

 in enumerate(shadow_loader, 0):
        # get the inputs; data is a list of [inputs, labels]
        inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)

        # zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # forward + backward + optimize
        outputs = shadow_model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

print('Finished Training the Shadow Model')
```

Performing the membership inference attack

```
attack_model = Net().to(device)
optimizer = optim.SGD(attack_model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

# Train the attack model on the outputs of the shadow model
for epoch in range(10):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
    for i, data in enumerate(test_loader, 0):
        # get the inputs; data is a list of [inputs, labels]
        inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)

        # zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # forward + backward + optimize
        shadow_outputs = shadow_model(inputs)
        attack_outputs = attack_model(shadow_outputs.detach())
        loss = criterion(attack_outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

print('Finished Training the Attack Model')

# Check if the samples from the test_loader were in the training set of the target model
correct = 0
total = 0

with torch.no_grad():
    for data in test_loader:
        images, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)
        outputs = attack_model(target_model(images))
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print('Accuracy of the attack model: %d %%' % (100 * correct / total))
```
The attack model is trained to infer if a given output from the shadow model was based on a sample that was present in the training set of the target model. This is a simplified scenario and actual attacks could be much more complex, incorporating noise and other factors to better simulate real-world conditions.
